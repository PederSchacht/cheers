Cheers
========================================

This simple app should ask you for your name then output a cheer, for example:

    Give me an... A
    Give me a.... B
    Give me a.... B
    Give me a.... Y
    ABBY’s just GRAND!

When given the input of “Abby”.

Note: the “a” vs. “an”

This was my first app written for the Ruby portion of Nashville Software School's Cohort 4.
